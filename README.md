# Income Tax Calculator

## About this Calculator

I have long been a fan of excel spreadsheets, and for years I found myself calculating income tax by using them. I decided I would instead like to create a web application which can calculate your income tax for you! I know there are plenty of tax calculators out there, but by creating this one, I can have control over the code, and hopefully get a better understanding of javascript in the process. 
## Current Limitations

» Since the web app is not yet complete, you will need to run this chunk of JavaScript in your browser's console<br>
» This program will only accept submissions from Michigan Residents<br>
» This program will only accept submissions from those filing as "Single"<br>
» This probram will NOT accept submissions from those who are Self Employeed<br>

In the near future, I hope to add functionality to allow for user from all across the United States, regardless of filing status or employment status.
